    "#MongoDB:\n",
    "#MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database management system. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB is designed to be scalable and provides high performance, flexibility, and easy scalability for handling large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Non-relational databases:\n",
    "#Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that does not follow the traditional relational database model. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases are schema-less and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They are suitable for scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and fast access to large amounts of data are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Scenarios to prefer MongoDB over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Flexible Schema: MongoDB allows dynamic schema, which means each document in a collection can have a different structure.\n",
    "#Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally by sharding, making it easier to handle large amounts of data and traffic.\n",
    "#Document Storage: It is well-suited for storing complex, hierarchical data structures as documents, which can include arrays and other documents.\n",
    "#JSON/BSON Format: MongoDB uses a format similar to JSON (BSON), which is more natural for developers to work with, especially in web applications.\n",
    "#Agile Development: MongoDB's flexibility is advantageous in agile development environments where requirements can change rapidly."
